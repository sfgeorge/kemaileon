kemaileon masks (or obfuscates) e-mail addresses to make it safer to publish them on Web sites.

Many spammers use e-mail harvesters - programs that scour the Web to find e-mail addresses.  kemaileon masks e-mail addresses, making it much harder for spammers to build such e-mail address lists with automated tools.

Many e-mail obfuscators use JavaScript or image generation in order to mask e-mail addresses; the disadvantage to those solutions is that they do not work for all intended (human) visitors.  Some of the goals of this project include developing a tool and api for generating masked addresses, using accessibility-friendly methods.
